First year, second year, third year, fourth year concept peer of college actually step by step so hi guys, I'm Nishantha Har I'm an ex Microsoft software engineer currently building Algo Prep and Tayari the major important part is problem solve Karpar problem solve language within problem solve Karakto it is well and good so 2024, 2025 but Jabi video from basics of Java to advanced problems for example but is valime to the basics of Java Miljaga resources attached basics of Java to Mihasa or C plus plus resources basics of C plus plus variables and you can get started with any one of the languages Day 1 or 2 Space and time complexity sickness space and time complexity program and time and it is very important Next recursion and backtracking Companies have the economy space complexity Definitely check out Karakti space and time complexity similarly backtracking recursion resources Definitely check out Karakteho 11 to 25 day mega Karnama basic linear data structure Karnatam language Karago problems we solve Karna arrays English tax and queues Next important suggestion actually real world test online assessment and it is very important 26 to 40 day searching seeking sorting Seeking sorting algorithm important then hash maps mostly videos Definitely check out Price point Next 41 to 65 days Shortest path for all like from source source to all vertices algorithms and for dynamic programming Memorization or tabulation Tabulation and memorization Memorizations are important because to me recursion say memorization and it will definitely help you out next 66 days to 75 days and finally 76 to 90 days my important topics Number theory, Hoga bit manipulation but data structures exactly data structure time complexity Easy questions Karnalag Jagadhma practice Karni Paragi Next Purapna Hase Next is Ade project ideas up to NASA projects Project ideas or change GUI clone Banajata streaming service Manasakto WhatsApp Firebase Important tips for resume Important tips for LinkedIn profile LinkedIn profile Recruiters podcast Recent times, Google, Amazon, Microsoft Jesse Companies Deloitte Service product donor finally off campus 90 days GSA challenge randomly choose Karajangi participate free trial like enroll type we'll get all your details 90 days the code Karna her milestone 30 day 60 day and 90 day first day 90 day progress. Com choose current and we'll give you the membership for two years for free membership membership around 45005000 extra discount Miljaga free trial so this is the challenge Next algorithms that would be a very good project for you as well but visualizerly sorting and pathfinding sorting and pathfinding is say check out Gasakta for example many have a merge sort Hamney sorting exactly sorting algorithm chalra similarly pathfinding algorithm registrar use Karim blocks medium hard many you are an experienced software engineer seven years experience from DSM interview dynamic programming you can use AI actually to help you out it will be good for a beginner and ask them modify this plan for me and GPT modify GPT Claude next to mock interviews final round AI website mock interviews basically similarly and third website give mock interviews and last but not the least what are the things that I might not have done Google interviewer for the last seven years five years six years and help me improve my coding practices coding style chances increase number and email Idana I'll share both the things with you on WhatsApp links coding pattern you will improve a lot for sure Tobas this is adr yesre DS and yeah thank you so much for watching this video. I hope upload a video chilling video chilli like subscribe.
